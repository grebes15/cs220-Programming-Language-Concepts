#Lab 5: Lists in Python


#Part 1
#Write a Python function that takes a list and an item and return the number of occurrences of that item in the list (possibly zero).
def count(x,y):
	c = 0 #set the counter to zero
	for i in x: #for all items in the list x
		if i == y: #if the item is found in the list
			c += 1 #add 1 to the counter
	return c #return how many of that item is in the list

a = [1,2,4,3,2,4,5,3,2,2,3,2,2]
print count(a,2) #print how many 2's are in the list a

print count(a,1) #print how many 1's are in the list a 

print count (a,4)#print how many 4's are in the list a

print count (a,6)#print how many 6's are in the list a

#Part 2
#Write a Python that takes two lists and returns a list containing all elements taht are in both lists (don't worry about duplicates).

def common(a,b):
	result = [] #set the result to be an empty list to start
	for i in a: #for all items in a
		if i in b: #for all itmes in b
			result.append(i) #adding an item to the end of the list
			#result[len(result):] = [i] #you could also do this
	return result #return what is in both lists
	
c = [3,2,5,4,6,7,4]
d = [7,2,8,9,4]

print common(c,d)

#Part 3
#Write a function taht takes two lists and returns a list containing all elements that are in one or the other list, bot NOT both.

def notcommon(a,b):
	result = [] #set the result to be an empty list to start
	for i in a: # for all items in a
		if i not in b: #if an item is not in b
			result = set(a) - set(b) | set(b) - set(a)
#assign the list to the items that are in a or b but not both
	return result #retuwrn the list of the items
	
print notcommon(c,d) #print the list of items that are in c or d but not both

e = [1,4,5,7,3,9,5,3,7,3]
f = [8,2,4,1]
#list e and f are used to test out for Part 3
print notcommon(e,f) #print the list of items that are in e or f but not both

#Part 4
#Write a function tayht takes a list and an integer k and rotates the list k positions to the left. (If k is negative, rotate to the right by -k positions)

def rotate(a,k):
	result = []
	for i in range(len(a)):
		return a[k:] + a[:k] 

g = [1,2,3,4]
print rotate(g,1)
print rotate(g,-1)
